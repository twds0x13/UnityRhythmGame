    m_Localized: " The pinnacle of the core spectrum of the Wu Duan system. Seven
      years of my charting essence culminate here: extreme note alignment\u2014even
      at 0.6x speed, every note remains perfectly aligned; intricate note patterns
      featuring solutions most charters could never conceive; exceptional courage\u2014I
      employ every dangerous configuration others dare not use; unbeatable patience\u2014every
      repeated musical passage is entirely redesigned; my will embodies a charting
      philosophy of extreme precision, stable rest sections, and innovative climaxes.
      This chart contains every conceivable pattern, offering zero repetition from
      start to finish, deserving to be experienced by all at a reduced speed. This
      is the ultimate proof. This is the final destination of conventional charting.
      \"I have passed the ultimate proof; now I must enter Laputa."
